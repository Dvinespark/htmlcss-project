                                <p>Bazar Mulya is a small effort to help the market of Nepal towards transparency and price consistency.</p>
                                <p>    
                                    We do not control any of the prices that are listed on the site.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Prices are fed by the public, and location admins of respective localities. These prices are then evaluated by the system to provide the best one.
                                </p>

                            <p class="w3-large">Why Bazar Mulya?</p>
                            <div  class="w3-text-grey w3-justify">
                                <p>We all remember the Gorkha quake that struck Nepal on Baisakh 12. And how it affected the peoples lives. Many lost their lives in that disaster. But the quake wasn't the worst part of it. It was what followed after.</p>
                                <p>    
                                    Following the quake, the market prices to skyrocket with no valid reasons. Shopkeepers would sell goods at whatever prices they wanted. Not all could afford buying the daily goods at these prices. And this is what affected peoples lives the most. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This wasn't the only event that inspired the founding of Bazar Mulya. The blockade that India cast on Nepal brought about the same. The price hike affected our lives then as well.
                                </p>
                                <p> And that is where Bazar Mulya comes in. Bazar Mulya gives you the option to look up prices online at any location and find the best price for you. It also help keep track of unusual price hikes, making the market more or less transparent and consistent.</p>
